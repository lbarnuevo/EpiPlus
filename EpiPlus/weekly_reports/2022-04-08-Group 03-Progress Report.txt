This week we wanted to continue programming point 10.
=========================================

-----------

This week we were able to continue with point 10 and advance a big part of it
===================

Because we had more practice classes last week, we advanced a lot of the programming part of the project
so we wouldn't have a huge work load on Holy week.
-----------

Next week we will continue programming (point 10) and rethink some parts of the project
========================

Because after the presentation we had some insight from outside, and we want to take into account
some problems that have been planteated to us during the feedback.
